Note: Age categories will be merged if data doesn't contain date
(e.g. if only 11-20, then 20-24 and 25-29 will share value)

DSV = Data source value 
0 = media, 1 = government, 2 = paper, 3 = relevant paper


Often the question people respond to isn't directly related - but the closest question to "will you get the COVID-19 vaccine" was chosen
Some had qualitative scales (completely disagree, somewhat disagree, neutral, somewhat agree, completely agree). Because getting vaccinated is an active choice, disagree/neutral counts as hesitant
